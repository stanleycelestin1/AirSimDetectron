# AirsimDetectron
Airsim integraded with Detectron.



Detectron is Facebook AI Research's software system that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870). It is written in Python and powered by the [Caffe2](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2) deep learning framework.

## Introduction

Airsim out of Microsoft Research (MSR AIR)is a Unreal plugin that can simply be dropped in
to any Unreal environment you want. Detectron Facebook (FAIR) research platform for object detection research, implementing popular 
algorithms like Mask R-CNN and RetinaNet. The idea for this project is to use state of the art objection 
detection in a state of the art simulator. The vision is that other researchers and engineers 
can use this project as a foundation for things like autonomous navigation. 




## Installation

Install Unreal Engine 4.18 (Need for Airsim)
