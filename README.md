Detectron is Facebook AI Research's software system that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870). It is written in Python and powered by the [Caffe2](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2) deep learning framework.

At FAIR, Detectron has enabled numerous research projects, including: [Feature Pyramid Networks for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144), [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870), [Detecting and Recognizing Human-Object Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07333), [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002), [Non-local Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07971), [Learning to Segment Every Thing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10370), [Data Distillation: Towards Omni-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04440), [DensePose: Dense Human Pose Estimation In The Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00434), and [Group Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494).

## Introduction

The goal of Detectron is to provide a high-quality, high-performance
codebase for object detection *research*. It is designed to be flexible in order
to support rapid implementation and evaluation of novel research. 


## Update

- 4/2018: Support Group Normalization - see [`GN/README.md`](./projects/GN/README.md)
